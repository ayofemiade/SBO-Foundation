                    <h2>Our Foundation Story</h2>
                    <p>The SBO Foundation was established in 2018 to honor and continue the remarkable legacy of Simeon Babafemi Olaleye (1928-2018), affectionately known as Pa SBO. After 90 years of impactful living, Pa SBO left behind a testament to what one person can achieve through unwavering dedication to family, community, and moral excellence.</p>
                    <p>Founded by his children and loved ones, the Foundation serves as a living memorial that transforms grief into purpose, memories into action, and love into lasting change. We believe that the best way to honor Pa SBO's memory is to ensure his values continue to shape lives and communities for generations to come.</p>
                    <p>What began as a family's desire to preserve their father's legacy has evolved into a beacon of hope for young leaders, students, and communities who share Pa SBO's vision for a better world.</p>
